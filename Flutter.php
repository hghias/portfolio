		<h3 class="text-center"> <b>The Goal</b> </h3>
		<p>The project was to create an ambient communication device/system for artdes 345: Interaction Design. We had to design an ambient device that allows for two-way communication between two “extreme” family members.</p>
		</br>
		
		<h3 class="text-center"> <b>Research</b> </h3>
		</br>
	 	<h5> <b> Hunt Statement </b></h5>
		<h3>We want to learn about the relationships between children and divorced parents (estranged) to help develop and maintain intimate emotional connections between them.</h3>
		</br>
		
		<h5> <b> Research </b></h5>
		<p>We interviewed three people affected by their parents’ divorces. </p>
		<ul>
			<li> Two affected at young age, one in late teens </li>
			<li> Current ages: late teens, early twenties, late thirties </li>
		</ul>
		<p>Interview Questions: </p>
		<ul>
			<li> Describe your family.</li>
			<li> What was your relationships with and between parents like pre, during and post divorce?  </li>
			<li> How has divorce impacted your emotions, behaviors and strength of bonds? </li>
			<li> How did you cope with or perceived the divorce?  </li>
		</ul>
		<p>From the interviews, we found that for children affected at a young age, living with one parent was normal. Often it was the father who left the household and children lost connection with extended family of estranged parent. There was different levels of contact depending on physical location and relationship between parents.</p>
		<p>For our secondary research, we researched the influence of divorce on child and parent, with a focus on psychological wellbeing and strength of relationship. We also looked into ways of rebuilding relationships between the estranged parent and child. Our research confirmed the fact that it was usually the fathers who left after the divorce. We not only learned about the child's impact but also the impact on the parent: older divorced men without a partner become particularly vulnerable during old age and they feel increased anxiety, loneliness and guilt for leaving their child. </p>
		<p>Since we had just a few days to conduct interviews and compile research, we had to make some assumptions and had some blindspots</p>
		<ul>
			<li> Interviews conducted were with subjects older than the target age group </li>
			<li> Were not able to conduct interviews with divorced parents </li>
		</ul>

		<h5> <b> Scenarios </b></h5>
		<div class="row">
				<div class="col-lg-4">
					<p>Scenario 1: </br> Henry gets home from work early at 6pm, and wants to check in on Rachel. It’s midnight where she is, so he isn’t sure if she’s still awake but still wants to reach out. He tries calling her, but Rachel declines his call. This is the third instance in two weeks, and Henry is worried about Rachel, and frustrated that she won’t talk to him. He feels helpless and is unsure of what to do.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-4">
					<p>Scenario 2: </br> Rachel performed poorly on a math exam and is afraid to tell her mom, and wants her dad to break the news to her mom but knows that he is always busy. Thus she doesn’t even bother reaching out. Rachel feels like she can’t even talk to her dad anymore.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-4">
					<p>Scenario 3: </br> Rachel has an important music audition coming up, and wants to talk about it with her dad, whom she always went to for advice. She is able to call her dad, but he seems like he is in a rush and keeps getting distracted. She keeps having to repeat herself, which makes her frustrated and upset.</p>

		<h5> <b> Sketches </b></h5>
		<p>The first sketch is am emotion tracker lamp - a bedside lamp that users can input their mood into and that will change the color of the connected lamp. Both users can keep track of their own day and see how the other party’s day was like. An app for the parent allows them to see what their children have inputted and also share how they’re feeling, They can also leave voice messages that their children can play from the lamp.</p>
		<p>The second sketch is a vibration bracelet - allows users to set touch patterns for specific messages such as “I love you” or “I miss you” that send to the recipient’s bracelet. An app for the parent allows them to see what their kids have sent them and send a touch pattern back. </p>
		<p>We realized these ideas didn't allow for meaningful connection - A teenager who is upset with her father and won't take a phone call, wouldn't willingly input her own feelings or want to communicate through vibrations. We needed something that would help facilitate that communication, rebuild their connection and also didn't connect the Henry and Rachel together 100%. This was when we came up with the idea of a digital whiteboard that would give them prompts, games and drawing exercises they could complete together to create positive interactions with each other. </p>
