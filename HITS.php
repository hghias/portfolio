    <h4> <b> The Problem </b></h4>
    <p>Health Information Technology & Services (HITS) provides Michigan Medicine employees with technology-related information, products, services, and support. The Service Portal is an online patform that aims to lead customers who are looking for hardware, software or an IT service to the right place the first time. However we found that in the last 12 months 42% of calls and general requests could've been resolved through the service portal. I was brought to the team to understand how customers are using the Service Portal, how successful they are in finding what they're looking for, and what design changes can improve efficiency.</p>

    </br>
    <h5> <b> Key Findings </b></h5>
    <ul>
        <li>How customer contacts HITS depends on the urgency and complexity of the problem</li>
        <li> Most prefer to
            <ol>
                <li> go to their onsite tech help </li>
                <li> call or chat </li>
                <li> Submit a general ticket</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>One customer was familiar with the service portal, but no one had used the service catalog before</li>
        <li>Hesitance to use service catalog because: 
            <ul>
                <li> <i>“Without you showing me this was the right way to go and that I’m ordering the right thing, I’d be a little leery [to use the service catalog to order something]”</i> </li>
                <li> They are not sure if they need approval from a manager/admin and want to know who’s getting charged </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Categories & Products
            <ul>
                <li> Customers had some trouble navigating through the catalog categories </li>
                <li> Confusion on whether a software is free or not </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Search
            <ul>
                <li> Some customers went straight to search, others were hesitant because they didn’t expect to find what they were looking for </li>
                <li> Pleasantly surprised to see that search results are easy to navigate </li>
                <li> Some customers used search for non-catalog items </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Tours
            <ul>
                <li> Some found it helpful, others did not like how thorough it was </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    </br>
    <h5> <b> Ideate </b></h5>
    <p>Based on the insights from the first round of interviews, I created redesigns and will be conducting usability tests using these mockups to see if the task success rate improves.</p>
