    <h3 class="text-center"> <b>Strategize</b> </h3>
    <h5> <b> Background </b></h5>
    <p>Health Information Technology & Services (HITS) plays an integral role in the success of Michigan Medicine by providing clinicians, educators, researchers, students, and staff with exceptional technology-related information, products, services, and support. The goal of the Service Portal is to lead the customer to the “right place” the “first time”--in other words, to support an experience that is simple, correct, and direct. </p>
    <ul>
    	<li>If something is broken, a call to the service desk or using the “Report a Problem” form are the simplest and most direct methods.</li>
    	<li>To request something, navigating to or searching for the relevant service catalog item are the simplest and most direct methods.</li> 
    </ul>
    <h5> <b> The Problem </b></h5>
    <p>The assumption, based on limited data and customer input, is that a significant proportion of the customers are trying to reach these “right places” and failing.  A prime example includes using “Report a Problem” for something covered by a Service Catalog item.  The result for the customer is often frustration and time wasted in being redirected to the “right place”.  From an internal perspective, the “right places” also align with the most resource efficient methods as well.  Time taken to recover from misrouted work is inefficient and burdensome to a Service Desk that is already stretched thin. </br>
    Phase II aims to understand how the customer uses the Service Portal to find the “right place” for their issues, how successful they are being, and what we can do to make that effort as simple, correct, direct, and efficient as possible. I joined the team as the UX expert. I will construct and conduct user interviews, develop suggestions based on user feedback, and iterate across interview cohorts.</p>
    </br>
    <h5> <b> Current State </b></h5>
    <p>In the last 12 months, 42% (53,793) of all Incidents handled by the Service Desk were categorized as Service Requests.  Of those, 84% (45,207) originated on the phone and 9% originated from the “Submit a Problem” form.</p>
    <h5> <b> Future State </b></h5>
    <p>Upon completion of the multi-phase Service Catalog Continuous Improvement project, we will have improved the customer experience by optimizing the service portal and catalog in such a way that customers find the correct service as simply, directly, and efficiently as possible. </br>
    This will reinforce customer trust and confidence in our content, and inform our design of how users interact with our services.  In practice, this will also reduce the operational burden on the service desk and allow us to better allocate resources. </p>
    <h5> <b> Project Success Criteria </b></h5>
    <ul>
    	<li>Conduct customer experience research and analysis </li>
    	<li>Generate slidedeck with findings and recommendations </li> 
    	<li>Present findings to Business IT Management, Service Operations Improvement program stakeholders, and HITS Service Owners. </li>
    	<li>Prioritize improvements for Phase III of the project</li>
    	<li>Suggested changes are within Service Now customization constraints</li>
    </ul>
