                <h4> <b> The Problem </b></h4>
                <h4 style="line-height:35px;"> Learning how to <b>express emotions in a positive way</b> is difficult for children to learn, but has a huge impact on their emotional maturity and overall health. Since children develop their emotional vocabulary between the age of <b>18 months to 4 years old,</b> they need an engaging way to learn how to label and identify emotions. This is where Munchies comes in handy. Children feed Munchies everyday with the color jellybean that corresponds with how they are feeling that day. This helps children <b>learn to label and identify their emotions</b> and helps parents communicate with their children. Munchies is a cute and approachable monster and by feeding him, the child develops an emotional bond, encouraging consistent behavior. </h4>

        <h4> <b> The Challenge</b></h4>
        <p> Transform a rock into a companion that leverages cuteness and the <b>delightful design principles</b> (engagement, surprise, liveliness, cuteness, serendipity, and reassurance) to induce or support a behavioral change that benefits the user's mental, physical or emotional well-being. </p>

        <h4> <b> Initial Research </b></h4>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <p> To learn more about wellbeing, I turned to the book <b>Positive Computing</b> by Dorian Peters and Rafael A. Calvo.</p>
                <p>The most interesting model of wellbeing outlined in the book is <b>subjective wellbeing</b> which consists of life satisfaction, the presence of positive mood and the absence of negative mood.</p>
                <p>The different approaches for designing positive computing are a <b>preventative approach,</b> where obstacles to wellbeing are treated as errors and trigger redesign, <b>active approach, </b> where technology is designed to actively support components of wellbeing in an app that has a different overall goal or <b> dedicated approach,</b> where technology dedicated to fostering wellbeing and/or human potential in some way.</p>
                <p> From the wellbeing factors chart, the factors I'm most interested in incorporating positive emotions, motivation & engagement, self-awareness and mindfulness, through a preventative or active positive computing approach.</p>

        </br>

        <h4> <b> Sketches </b></h4>
        <p> By understanding the models of wellbeing, the factors that impact wellbeing and the approaches to designing positive computing, I narrowed down what type of problems I wanted to tackle. My initial sketches tackle <b>preventative or active aspects to improving emotional health and mindfulness.</b> Through multiple sessions of critique, I narrowed my idea based on <b>impact and feasibility</b> to building a <b>mood tracker</b> and to cutify it, I decided to make a little monster that you feed different color jellybeans that correspond with how you were feeling that day. This allows you to track how you've been feeling over a period of time and be mindful about why you've been feeling the way you are. </p>

        <p> To further define the product, I did some research into similar products in the market, different models of emotion and which age range this product could be most beneficial too. </p>

            <li> <b>Emotional literacy</b> is the ability to identify, understand, and respond to emotions in oneself and others in a healthy manner.</li>
            <li>Children who have a <b>strong foundation in emotional literacy</b> tolerate frustration better, get into fewer fights, engage in less self-destructive behavior, are healthier, less lonely, less impulsive, more focused, and they have greater academic achievement.</li>
            <li> <b>Three variables in child’s ability to label emotions:</b> (1) the child’s temperament and developmental status, (2) parental socialization and environmental support, and (3) the teacher and child care providers’ emphasis on emotional literacy.</li>
            <li> <b>Strategies to foster emotional literacy in children:</b> express your own feelings, label children's feelings, and play games, sing songs, and read stories with new feeling words.</li>

        <ul >
            <li>Most children begin to <b>attach labels to emotions when they reach 18 months of age </b> and they become able to <b>discuss feeling states they have experienced by 28 months.</b> </li>
            <li> The ability to label emotions on the basis of expressive and situational cues is <b>closely linked to verbal ability</b></li>
            <li> <b>Differential emotions theory</b> states that each emotion has an adaptive function that stems from its motivational quality. Emotions can be activated by cognitions, physiological states, or other emotions. As children develop, emotions self-organize into patterns that can be activated by environmental events.</li>
            <li>Throughout early and middle childhood <b>repeated misperception of emotion cues may lead to inefficient or maladaptive emotion patterns</b> and emotion–cognition structures that activate negative emotions such as shame, guilt, sadness, and fear at inappropriate times.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>A Tamagotchi was, by design, supposed to simulate aliveness — complete with the messy realities that come with owning a pet.</li>
            <li> It was helpless without its users and, in return for our raising it, an emotional bond was formed.</li>
        </ul>
        </br>
        
        <h4> <b> Prototyping </b></h4>
        <p>I haven't worked with clay in a very long time, so I did a lot of experimenting to make sure that the structure is strong and wouldn't crack when the clay is being baked. At the same time I was trying to make sure that the monster looked cute and had a big enough and easily accessible mouth to make sure it's functionable. </p>
        <div class="row text-center">
            <div class="col text-center">
                <img src="Munchies/MunchiesPrototype.jpg" alt="" style="width:100%;">
            </div>
        </div>
        </br>
        <p>After a few iterations, I decided on creating a rounded body with the mouth wide open and a big tongue sticking out. The monster has curved eyes, small ears and arms and stubby feet to add to the approachability, cuteness and vulnerability.</p>
        </br>

         <h4> <b> Packaging </b></h4>
         <p>I wanted the packaging to show off the monster so that kids could see and interact with it on the shelves of a store and to create a home for it. The emotions chart is based off of the Circumplex Model.</p>
