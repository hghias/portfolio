				In Arabic, Hafsa means lioness. I have always resonated with what my name means

				qualities embody
				my work speaks to that: it's strong, powerful.

				My name has always helped me draw ambition, creativity and confidence .  I've always drawn power from it. I like to think my passion, creativity and courage comes from my name.

				I’m a recent graduate from the University of Michigan with a B.A in art & design with a focus on user experience design. I started my college career in software development, but changed my focus to UX design when I fell in love with design and its potential to change the world. With a strong drive for solving problems, I enjoyed shaping what products look like and how they function more than building them.
				</br>
				</br>
				I aim to use design as a tool to foster inclusivity & create equal opportunity. I’m passionate about bringing people together by breaking down barriers, whether that be personal, cultural, or structural barriers. With a background in computer science, my goal is to design user interfaces with regards to the limitations that arise in the development phase. In all the projects that I pursue, I ask <I> “How can we maximize this design to be intuitive, functional, inclusive & aesthetic?” </I>

			<!-- I gained an understanding of the agile workflow by completing an end-to-end project.  !-->
			<h5 style= "line-height: 150%;"> During my software development internship at Ally Financial working on an end-to-end project, I realized that I wanted to shape what products look like and how they function, rather than making them. And that’s how I found UX. The next summer I went back to Ally as a UX designer and I loved it. I was embedded in an agile team and owned a feature that I got to see through its launch. I also had the opportunity to work on developing a pattern library. Currently, I am interning at Michigan Medicine as UX researcher where I have developed our research methods which includes user interviews and usability testing. Next week I am going to start conducting the first of 30 user interviews. Throughout my time at college, I’ve also been freelancing as a web designer and developer, branding designer and photographer. And this experience has taught me how to help my clients communicate their design needs and how to put my clients needs over what I think might look nice.

			<!-- <h2> Design Philosophy </h2>
			</br>
			<h5 style= "line-height: 150%;">Design is all around us. But the best products, physical or digital, are ones that you don’t realize have been designed, because they've been seamlessly integrated into our lives. Because they've been designed with the user in mind. they offer an effective solution to a problem you may or may not be aware of or make your day to day life more efficient.
			</br>
			</br>
			Take the design of a door for instance. You use doors everyday. The act of opening and closing a door is a mundane one and is gone unnoticed if it’s intuitive – a quality of good design. However, if it’s too heavy to open or push or pull, the door becomes an obstacle and is considered poor design. Additionally, one must think about the different types of users for a given design as well. What may be an easy door for able-bodied users could serve as a difficulty for users in wheelchairs if there’s no handicap door opener. Understanding the target audience of your brand, digital interface, or product and adapting your design so it’s inclusive and accessible to everyone is every designer’s responsibility.

			<h2> My Design Process </h2>
			</br>
			<h5 style= "line-height: 150%;"> I believe that process is important because it makes sure I am intentional with every decision. My design process has been abstracted from the UX design process so it can be applied to any project I am working on, whether it is product design, branding design or graphic design. Good design is human centered -  which means that it is empathetic, so conducting user research is one of the most important steps. I strive to understand the client's goals and user's needs and translate them into a visual that satisfies the client and user.</h5>
