				<h2> Hi, I'm Hafsa! It's nice to meet you! </h2>
				</br>
				<h5 style= "line-height: 150%;">
				&emsp; I’m currently a senior at the University of Michigan studying art & design with a focus on user experience design. I started my college career pursuing software development, but have since fallen in love with the potential design has to change the world. Engineering makes things work, but design impacts if, how and why we use something. 
				</br>
				</br>
				&emsp; In all the projects that I pursue, I always try to answer: <I> “How can we maximize this design to be intuitive, functional, inclusive & aesthetic?” </I>

				<h2> Why is Design Important? </h2>
				</br>
				<h5 style= "line-height: 150%;">  &emsp; Design is everywhere around us. But the best products, physical or digital, are ones that you don’t realize have been designed, because they’re intuitive, inclusive and aesthetic.
				</br>
				</br>
				&emsp; You use doors everyday. The act of opening and closing a door is a mundane one. And if it’s easy to use, you won’t notice it – a quality of good design. But if it’s too heavy to open or you’re not sure how to use it, you’ll notice it and comment on the poor design. Additionally, everyone has different needs that design has to cater to. What may be an easy door to use for able-bodied users may be a limitation for users in wheelchairs because there’s no handicap door opener. Understanding the target audience of your brand, website, app, or product and adapting your design so it’s inclusive and accessible to everyone is every designer’s responsibility.
				</br>
				</br>
				&emsp; I strive to achieve a sense of invisibility and inclusivity in my design by understanding the client’s goals and the user’s needs that I blend into simple, functional and aesthetic design.
