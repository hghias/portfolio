			<h5 style= "line-height: 150%;"> I’m a UX designer with design and development experience in the fintech, medical and e-commerce industries (<a style="color:#48A2B5;" href="#experience">see my experiences</a>). I've learned how to easily navigate and translate complex systems and compliance into user friendly experiences. My development background allows me to understand and collaborate effectively with engineering partners. With a strong drive for solving problems, I enjoy being involved in the whole design process including conducting user research, creating prototypes, and coding (<a style="color:#48A2B5;" href="#process">see my design process</a>). My goal is to use design as a tool to foster inclusivity and creating equal opportunity. I’m passionate about bringing people together by breaking down barriers, whether they are personal, cultural, technological or structural.
			</br>
			</br>
			I'm always trying out something new - my recent endeavors have been learning animation and woodworking. Coding keeps me on my toes and developing this portfolio site taught me a lot about front-end development, analytics and devops. When I'm not designing, I try to spend as much time outside and can be found drawing, reading, hiking or with a camera in my hand! 
			</br>
			</br>
			I am currently looking for full time UX opportunities where I can be involved in the whole design process and learn from seasoned designers. I am also open to freelance design or photography projects.

			<h2> <b>My Design Process</b> </h2>
			</br>
			<h5 style= "line-height: 145%;"> As a full stack UX designer, I enjoy being involved in the full design process, but being able to work directly with users is one of the reasons why I love UX so much. My goal with every project is to understand the business needs, user goals and technology constraints and find a solution that satisfies all three spaces. I believe open communication, trust, and feedback is the key to finding balance and creating a great product! While the design process is more often than not as linear or cyclical as my process diagram below, the diagram visualizes how I approach any problem! </h5>

			I gained an understanding of the agile workflow by completing an end-to-end project. 

			<h5 style= "line-height: 150%;"> During my software development internship at Ally Financial working on an end-to-end project, I realized that I wanted to shape what products look like and how they function, rather than making them. And that’s how I found UX. The next summer I went back to Ally as a UX designer and I loved it. I was embedded in an agile team and owned a feature that I got to see through its launch. I also had the opportunity to work on developing a pattern library. Currently, I am interning at Michigan Medicine as UX researcher where I have developed our research methods which includes user interviews and usability testing. Next week I am going to start conducting the first of 30 user interviews. Throughout my time at college, I’ve also been freelancing as a web designer and developer, branding designer and photographer. And this experience has taught me how to help my clients communicate their design needs and how to put my clients needs over what I think might look nice. 
			</br>

			</br>
			</br>	
			<!-- <h2> Design Philosophy </h2>
			</br>
			<h5 style= "line-height: 150%;">Design is all around us. But the best products, physical or digital, are ones that you don’t realize have been designed, because they've been seamlessly integrated into our lives. Because they've been designed with the user in mind. they offer an effective solution to a problem you may or may not be aware of or make your day to day life more efficient.
			</br>
			</br>
			Take the design of a door for instance. You use doors everyday. The act of opening and closing a door is a mundane one and is gone unnoticed if it’s intuitive – a quality of good design. However, if it’s too heavy to open or push or pull, the door becomes an obstacle and is considered poor design. Additionally, one must think about the different types of users for a given design as well. What may be an easy door for able-bodied users could serve as a difficulty for users in wheelchairs if there’s no handicap door opener. Understanding the target audience of your brand, digital interface, or product and adapting your design so it’s inclusive and accessible to everyone is every designer’s responsibility.
