			<h5 style= "line-height: 145%;"> &emsp;I'm a user experience designer focused on using design as a tool to foster inclusivity and creating equal opportunity. I’m passionate about bringing people together by breaking down barriers, whether that be personal, cultural, technological or structural barriers. My name means 'lioness' in Arabic and just like the animal, I embody traits of creativity, curiosity, and ambition throughout the design process. In all the projects that I pursue, I ask <I> “How can we maximize this design to be intuitive, functional, inclusive & aesthetic?”</I> &nbsp;My development background allows me to understand and collaborate effectively with engineering partners. With experience in the fintech and medical industries, I can easily navigate and translate complex systems and compliance into user friendly experiences.
			</br>
			</br>
			&emsp;I graduated from the University of Michigan (Class of 2020) with a B.A. in art and design. My multidisciplinary education exposed me to a range of mediums and technologies. This allows me to experiment with how I can combine unique mediums to enhance my work today! I love learning and am always trying out something new - my recent endeavors have been learning animation and woodworking. Front-end development keeps me on my toes and coding this portfolio site taught me a lot about coding and devops. I try to spend as much time outside and can be found drawing, reading, hiking or with a camera in my hand! 
			</br>
			</br>
			&emsp;I am currently looking for full time UX opportunities and am also open to freelance design or photography projects. Feel free to reach out to me at <a style="color:#48A2B5;" href="mailto:hghias@umich.edu">hghias@umich.edu </a> for any work or collaboration opportunities or if you'd just like to chat :)

			<h2> <b>My Design Process</b> </h2>
			</br>
			<h5 style= "line-height: 145%;"> &emsp; As a full stack UX designer, I enjoy conducting user research and creating prototypes, but I am most in my element when designing new features to address user needs. I strive to understand the client's goals and user's needs and translate them into a design that satisfies the client and user. My design process has been abstracted from the UX design process so it can be applied to any project I am working on, whether it is product design, branding design or graphic design. </h5>

			I gained an understanding of the agile workflow by completing an end-to-end project. 

			<h5 style= "line-height: 150%;"> During my software development internship at Ally Financial working on an end-to-end project, I realized that I wanted to shape what products look like and how they function, rather than making them. And that’s how I found UX. The next summer I went back to Ally as a UX designer and I loved it. I was embedded in an agile team and owned a feature that I got to see through its launch. I also had the opportunity to work on developing a pattern library. Currently, I am interning at Michigan Medicine as UX researcher where I have developed our research methods which includes user interviews and usability testing. Next week I am going to start conducting the first of 30 user interviews. Throughout my time at college, I’ve also been freelancing as a web designer and developer, branding designer and photographer. And this experience has taught me how to help my clients communicate their design needs and how to put my clients needs over what I think might look nice.

			<!-- <h2> Design Philosophy </h2>
			</br>
			<h5 style= "line-height: 150%;">Design is all around us. But the best products, physical or digital, are ones that you don’t realize have been designed, because they've been seamlessly integrated into our lives. Because they've been designed with the user in mind. they offer an effective solution to a problem you may or may not be aware of or make your day to day life more efficient.
			</br>
			</br>
			Take the design of a door for instance. You use doors everyday. The act of opening and closing a door is a mundane one and is gone unnoticed if it’s intuitive – a quality of good design. However, if it’s too heavy to open or push or pull, the door becomes an obstacle and is considered poor design. Additionally, one must think about the different types of users for a given design as well. What may be an easy door for able-bodied users could serve as a difficulty for users in wheelchairs if there’s no handicap door opener. Understanding the target audience of your brand, digital interface, or product and adapting your design so it’s inclusive and accessible to everyone is every designer’s responsibility.
