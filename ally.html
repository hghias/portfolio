	<p> I spent the beginning of the summer learning how SmartAuction works, and how not only SA is structured, but also how the UX team works. The projects that I worked on evolved organically â€“ In the beginning of the summer I was tasked with conducting gap analyses and bridging any inconsistencies within the redesigned platform. Often times conducting an analysis of one thing uncovered a discrepancy in another space. I started off by conducting gap analysis for the different scenarios for a buyer to purchase a vehicle. This led to a full discrepancy analysis of all the redesigned pages in SA and from there I updated the common UI elements folder for POs & developers and created a library for designers to be able to easily pull elements from. Lastly one of the things that my manager asked me to do was to observe our UX process & make recommendations to improve our efficiency. I was able to contribute to journey mapping for posting a vehicle on SmartAuction with the other UX designers and attended the developer training to learn more about how Ally incorporates accessibility in the design process, development and testing.</p>
