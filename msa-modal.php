    <h3 class="text-center"> <b>The Challenge</b> </h3>
    <p> Muslim Students Association is a student organization at the University of Michigan that aims to serve the Muslim community of campus through religious programming, community building and service. MSA primarily uses social media to reach students about their events. However because MSA members are sharing events and flyers on their own pages, they’ve only been reaching the same people over and over again. Additionally, MSA has many resources available for Muslim students, but they aren't in an organized, public place where anyone can access them - only those who know about them use them. They approached me about redesigning the website to increase the organization’s visibility by making it easier for people outside the U of M MSA community to find and contact the organization, access their resources and meet with other Muslims on campus. </p>
	</br>
    <h3 class="text-center"> <b>Understanding the Problem </b> </h3>
    <h5> <b>Client Goals</b> </h5>
    <p> The client aims to revamp their website to generate more traffic, make the organization easier to discover and interact with, have a more professional presence on campus, and make their resources more accessible for new students, existing members and the broader community.</p>
    </br>

    <h5> <b> Stakeholder Interviews </b></h5>
    <p> To define the business requirements, I met with the MSA executive board and talked about who the target audience is, what they liked about the current website: content wise, organization wise and look & feel and what they thought was missing from the current website. 
    </br> Many of the board members felt that the website feels very somber and wanted to add more bright colors and photos of the community. MSA also has many resources, but they don’t do a good job sharing it with students. Some suggestions were to add the campus resource guide, a weekly calendar of events, and other resources onto the website to make it more accessible. Members also felt that the website needed a more prominently displayed mission statement, an easy way for people to donate to the organization and to make contacting the board and joining the MSA listservs more accessible. 
    </br> We also mapped out the target audience: current MSA members, freshman and other Muslim students who are not currently a part of MSA, Alumni who want to give back, Donors and community members who want to learn more about, contact, or collaborate with the organization.

    <h3 class="text-center"> <b>Research</b> </h3>
    <h5> <b>Field Studies</b> </h5>
    <p>I’ve been a part of MSA as a member for the four years I’ve been on campus and I’ve noticed that MSA is a hard community to find if you’re not on social media. We share all of our events and information through Facebook, however Facebook is losing popularity with the younger generation, so MSA needs to find other ways to reach out to the MSA community. That being said, we do get asked a lot of questions by prospective students and community members through Facebook messenger. Most of the questions are about resources, like where the housing list is, and about how they can reach out to the executive board. This shows that the website needs to clearly display our resources and contact us information.</p>
     </br>
    <h5> <b>User Interviews & Surveys</b></h5>
    <p>I developed an informal interview questionnaire to understand how users currently interact with MSA, what their needs and goals are and what they expect from MSA.</p>

    <p> After talking to users, I learned that many people did not know that we have a website. They initially heard about MSA from other people or other campus events such as Festifall and use social media and other people to stay up to date with what MSA is up to. Many students did not know much about the resources MSA has available and would prefer a pdf version that is available online. Many students said that they would use a website if they had known it exists and would access it mostly on their phones. </br> Based on these responses, the website design should be intuitive so it’s easy to click through to see what the website offers and should be mobile first design. It should also have a frequently updated events calendar and resources should be easily accessible.</p>
    </br>
    <h5> <b>Personas</b> </h5>
    <p> Based off of the stakeholder interview and user interviews, I developed four personas that would use the website.</p>
    <div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-6 pt-2 text-center">
			<img src="Personas-01.png" alt="" style="width:100%;">

		</div>
	</div>

	</br>

	<h5> <b>Comparative Analysis</b> </h5>

	<p> Before designing the website, we did some research on how other MSA around the world organize and design their websites. </p>
	<div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
		<div class="col-lg-7">
			<img src="MSA_comparativeanlaysis.png" alt="" style="width:100%;"> 
		</div>
	</div>

		</br>
	<p>The comparative analysis showed us that it’s very important to have a small, intuitive information architecture. Many of the websites we looked at had a large sitemap that was very overwhelming. Additionally, we thought the oxford MSA had the best home page because it summarized all the information provided in the tabs and had links for users to read more if they wanted to. The OSU MSA has a very streamlined design, with a chatbot and a pop up that prompts users to join listserv. We though both these very really great ways to interact with the users and show that the MSA is very accessibile.</p>	
</br>
<h5> <b>Requirements List</b> </h5>
<p> Based off of the stakeholders meeting, user research and comparative analysis, the executive board and I defined a list of usability and design requirements for the website.  </p>
<ul>
	<li> Wordpress website </li>
	<li> Responsive and mobile first design </li>
	<li> Bright colors & more icons & visuals </li>
	<li>Anonymous suggestion box </li>
	<li>Merchandise store that links user to google ordering form </li>
	<li> A list of ways students can get involved with MSA as a member </li>
	<li> Clearly defined resources for Muslims </li>
	<li> Campus Guide available as a downloadable pdf </li>
	<li> Public Calendar with upcoming community events </li>
</ul>
</br>
<h3 class="text-center"> <b>Ideate</b> </h3>
    <h5> <b>Sitemap</b> </h5>
    <p>The old MSA website had a sitemap that wasn’t intuitive - there were broken links, unnecessary pages and vague organization. We wanted the new website to have a less clunky navigation and to highlight our resources, how people can get involved, the msa community and an easy way to contact us.  At first we had a merch tab instead of a community one, but we realized that it was more important to share photos, highlight other students and the MSA community more than having a page dedicated to merchandise.

    </br>
    </br>
    <h5> <b>Wireframes</b> </h5>
    <p>We wanted most of the information to be available on the home page with links to the other pages if the user wanted more information. </p>

    <h3 class="text-center"> <b>Design</b> </h3>
    <h5> <b>Low Fidelity Mockup</b> </h5>
    <p>I developed a low fidelity mockup and created categories of the content based on the sitemap. Once these were designed, I sent them to the Operations Chair and she used this a guide to provide me with all the content I needed to develop a high fidelity mockup</p>

    <h5> <b>Development</b> </h5>
    <p>I implemented the website using Wix, so board members can easily keep the website updated. View the website <a href="http://www.muslims.studentorgs.umich.edu/" target="blank" style="color:#48A2B5;">here</a>.</p>

    <h3 class="text-center"> <b>Evaluate</b> </h3>
    <h5> <b>Reflection</b> </h5>
    <p> This is the first time I’ve worked for a client to design and develop a website, so this was a great learning experience for me! The biggest challenge I faced was how to communicate technical terms to non-technical people. I learned that I could overcome this by explaining my design & development process, what I need from my client (like content and feedback), what and why I am doing certain things (like user research, wireframing, etc...), and where all that fits into the end product. 
    </p>
    <p>Another challenge I faced was when I created the low fidelity mockup so that the client could provide me with the content, they didn’t completely understand the interaction in the website. For example it wasn’t clear that some information on the homepage were collapsible. In order to make it more clear, I could have made an interactable mockup so it’s easier to understand how the website works.</p>
