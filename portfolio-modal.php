	<h3 class="text-center"> <b>Understand the Problem</b> </h3>
	<p>I created my old portfolio website many years ago using a website builder. It’s not visually appealing, there are too many pages and the information architecture is not intuitive. My goal is to completely redesign my portfolio website using the UX process and code it from scratch. This will be a challenge because I’ve never coded a full website before and have no experience with frameworks, responsive development, optimization, and deployment. But I look forward to researching a lot and overcoming these challenges! I also identified different personas: recruiters and clients. The website is first and foremost for recruiters, so I will be focusing on what they are looking for in potential hires. </p>

	<h3 class="text-center"> <b>Research</b> </h3>
	<h5> <b>Comparative Analysis</b> </h5>
	<p>I researched other UX portfolios to gain inspiration for my layout, content organization and visuals.</p>

	<h5> <b>Requirements List</b> </h5>
	<p> Based on my research, I defined a list of usability and design requirements for the website.  </p>
	<ul>
		<li> Bright colors & gradients </li>
		<li> Animations & transitions to increase interactability </li>
		<li> Filters to organize projects </li>
		<ul>
			<li> Filters for design include: UX design, product design, branding design </li>
			<li> Filter by mediums for mixed media tab </li>
			<li> Filters for photography include: portraits, nature, urban and weddings </li>
		</ul>
		<li> Infinite scroll </li>
		<li> Ability for clients to download their photos </li>
		<li> Design gallery with links to their case studies </li>
	</ul>

	<h5> <b>Wireframes</b> </h5>
	<p>I wanted to make my landing page visually interesting and interactable. For the the pages with my work, there would be a gallery, with links to a modal with more information about my projects. </p>

	<h5> <b>Low Fidelity Mockup</b> </h5>
	<p>I developed a low fidelity mockup so I could start coding the framework of my website, </p>

	<h5><b>Branding</b> </h5>
	<p> Before I created a style guide, I decided to develop a brand for myself that I could incorporate into the site. I wanted to incorporate my initials and a lion because my name in Arabic means lioness. Below are my sketches: </p>

	</div>
	
	</br>
	
	<p>I struggled to decide on a logo and so I showed my sketches to a professor who suggested to create a monogram using my initials and incorporate part of the lion into the letters. He suggested that the lion shouldn't be really big because it would take attention away from my initials and would be the only thing people would focus on. Below is my final logo: </p>

	<h5> <b>Style Guide</b></h5>
	<p> Once I had a lofi mockup, I created a style guide so I could make a high fidelity mockup. </p>

	<h5> <b>First Iteration</b> </h5>
	<p> In my first iteration, I selected the projects that I wanted to display and then organized them into their respective pages.</p>
	</br>

	</div>
	
	</br>
	<h5> <b>Second Iteration</b> </h5>
		
	<p> In the second iteration, I started thinking more about animations and transitions and adding more aesthetics to the page. Additionally, I changed the home page to add a small intro to myself in the beginning, rather than at the end. This was one of the suggestions a UX designer gave me when she looked at my first iteration. I also drew out how the website would look on mobile view. </p>

	<p>This was the first time I coded a website, so I spent a lot of time researching at what to do at every step of the process. I started off by researching the best way to organize my code and start development. After extensive research, I decided to use CSS grids instead of flexboxes and bootstrap. As I started adding more to the website, it got harder and harder to develop using CSS grids. I reached out to some friends who have experience with development and they recommended that I should switch to Bootstrap. Initially, I had decided against using Bootstrap because it felt like taking the easy way out, but I learned that most websites are built using Bootstrap or a framework like Angular or React. Switching to Bootstrap turned out to be a great decision. Building the website page by page, I started with the landing page. Once all the styling was done, I added animations and transitions using a parallax library and AOS jquery library. 
	Once I was ready to start the design page, I realized I'd have to copy the whole nav bar over to the new page. It felt wrong to do that because if I made any changes to one, I’d have to copy it over to every page I had and that could get super messy, so I did some research. I learned that you can make a separate php file and add the navbar code in there and just include that php file into all the pages that I want the navbar to show up in, so I created separate nav, header and footer files and included them on all the pages to avoid duplicating code. For the design page, I started to research photo galleries that I could easily incorporate into my website that are: responsive, mobile swipe friendly, incorporate different medias, can integrate modals and lastly can be displayed as a gallery. I found many different libraries, but found that Fancybox best fit my needs. For the projects with case studies, I used the bootstrap modal feature.  </p>

	<h5> <b>Deployment</b> </h5>
	<p> After I finished my website, I had to figure out how to deploy my site. I decided to temporarily use Heroku and link it with Github for easy hosting. Once it was successfuly hosted and I connected my custom domain, I tackled optimization. The website was slow because image files were too big and that the site sleeps if it's not being used. I tackled this by using UptimeRobot which pings the website every so often to keep it live. Additionally, the free tier doesn't have SSL certificate, so I used Cloudfare to secure my site. </p>
	</br>
	<h3 class="text-center"> <b>Evaluate</b> </h3>
	<h5> <b>Usability Testing</b> </h5>
	<p> To test my website, I observed how multiple people interacted with it. One usability issue that was common was that users thought that the images on the home page were clickable, but they were not. I fixed this by making the images clickable.  </p>
